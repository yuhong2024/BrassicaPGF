## Introduction

**BrassicaPGF** is an open-access, integrative platform for systematic analysis and visualization of pan-gene families across six core Brassica species (B. rapa, B. oleracea, B. nigra, B. napus, B. juncea, B. carinata) and Arabidopsis. The database covers 39 high-quality genomes and over 350 gene families, providing advanced tools for gene family identification, cross-species comparison, evolutionary analysis, and functional annotation. BrassicaPGF aims to accelerate research in functional genomics, comparative genomics, and molecular breeding for Brassica crops by offering a user-friendly, data-rich, and interactive environment.
